File numbering is ...
1st number means how many expansions the real agent has already done,
 
2nd number goes 'backwards' as the simulator expands the tree, 
then all runs are listed in each file

TODO, improve
As far as the environment is concerned, it must be restored for the step
(1st digit) of the agent for each run
