5.2.1 Definition of the garden example
The garden example itself then specifies these rules:
• The agent is situated in a grid based environment that is 3x3 in size. Where each
space has its own zone. The agent starts in the upper left position that is [1,1].
• Every zone has a level of moisture that can range from 0 to 100.
• At the start, each zone has a different moisture level.
• The agent can either move from one zone to another or water a zone that is located
on the space where the agent currently is.
• The agent has a limited water tank that has a value of 10.
• The agent can only see zones around it and can only move to these zones, similar to
the task maze example.
• Agent knows about two zones that have the lowest moisture level, these zones are
marked as critical zones.
• After every action agent does in the environment, every zone degrades and its moisture
is reduced by 4.
• When an agent waters a zone, the moisture level is increased by 30 points and the
value of the water tank is decreased by one. If the agent has an empty water tank,
he can not water any zone.
• After the agent waters a critical zone, two zones with the lowest moisture level are
selected as critical zones.
• When an agent waters a zone, he receives a reward, where the value is determined by
the level of moisture the zone has after watering. If the agent waters a zone that has
a moisture level higher than 80, the reward is 1. If the moisture level is lower than 80
the reward is 2. In order to encourage agent to prioritize critical zone if the hydration
zone is lower, rather than watering zone that is already at 100.
• The agents continued goal is to water any critical zone.
