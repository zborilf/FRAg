1. Introduction

The FRAg system provides a number of ways to select resources during agent 
interpretation. The original system specifies that the selection of an event, 
a plan as a means to achieve goals, and the selection of an intention to be 
followed in the current step are non-deterministic. Their execution is then 
typically done by placing events in a queue and selecting from it, plans are 
chosen in the order in which they are declared in the program, and intentions 
are executed in a round robin fashion.


N. Implementation

To create a reasoning module you need to create a Prolog file and place it in
the \core\reasoning_methods directory (by convention). Such file is included
into the FRAg system, when the initial 
fe. see \core\fragini.mas2fp, it contains clause
include_reasoning("/reasoning_methods/Basic/FRAgPLReasoningSimple.pl").
that causes ... of the FRAgPLReasoningSimple.pl file
